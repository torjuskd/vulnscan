# vulnscan

A simple non-intrusive large scale vulnerability scanner

## Setup
To be able to run this application, you must have Subjack installed and
on your `PATH` for non-interactive shells.

This usually means that: To make your PATH entries available to /bin/sh scripts run by a specific user, 
add the PATH entry to the ~/.profile file or ~/.bash_profile or ~/.bash_login.
